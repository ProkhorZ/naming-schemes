# Thematic lists of names

This is a collection of thematic word lists that you could use to name a dozen or a few hundred files, servers or children if it doesn't matter what they're called. And there may be other use cases I've never heard of. I prefer lists that are ordered naturally, e.g. by size, so that you don't have to use alphabetical order every time.

Most of these lists contain some diacritics. Besides general comments at the top, the lists don't contain any explanations, so that you can copy a whole list at once, and use it to assign names automatically.

## History

This collection wasn't started in an office. Do you remember playing **Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri**? One of the things that made it an epic game was the characters of the faction leaders, *divided not by nationality, but by ideology*. The city names, on the other hand, were not as distinctive. It felt like they were all created by a 19th-century poet. Besides, I needed more names on big maps. So I created my own city names, using semantic domains that seemed suitable for each faction.

The **themes** folder contains the thematic lists in plain text, plus some comments at the start of the file. See the **basenames** folder [in the original *namenlijsten* repo](https://github.com/ProkhorZ/namenlijsten) for the faction files that you'd put in the Alpha Centauri folder. Those lists were a mixture of Dutch and English. This repo is going to be a general collection of thematic word lists in English, not limited to Alpha Centauri factions.
